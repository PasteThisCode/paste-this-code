                <p>Hi! My name is Adnan Issadeen and I'm a systems engineer at Buffer</p>
                <p>First up, thank you so much for taking the time to check out paste this code and a few pages within it.
                Paste this code is an idea that I've been hoping to bring to reality for nearly 2 years and I'm excited 
                that I feel like I finally have an execution that looks like it'll work the way I've always wanted it to.</p>
                <p>Paste This Code aims to be an ongoing log of projects that I've worked on in the past and am currently 
                working on. The logs will contain details of steps that I take to bring a project from point A to point B where 
                I'll be sharing my processes and reflections.</p>
                <p>I'll be working on projects ranging from evaluating and trying out frameworks/tools/cloud platforms, to
                working on coding challenges like Project Euler, or Advent of Code. I'll be working on side projects trying to
                build little products in the form of very small web apps or simple browser extensions. But most importantly, if 
                I can get approval I hope to be sharing perspectives into the work I do on a daily basis at Buffer. This would be
                a real, transparent look into what goes into being a systems engineer at a company like Buffer</p>
                <p>I'll also be blogging about new projects I'm starting on, and thoughts on tools and processes in the industry.
                Expect an <em>emphasis</em> on TDD and containers (I think we are long past the stage where one groans upon reading
                or hearing that word. :D )</p>
                <p>You could just read the <a href="http://blog.pastethiscode.com/reboot-hello/">reboot blog post I wrote about it too :)</a></p>
                <p>My hope is that this will prove to be an educational site eventually. I remember starting out in the software
                world wondering where on earth do I start picking up things from. Even now, I feel like I don't have a grasp 
                of anything! If I can help someone else who's never met me, purely through what I write here, even if it's
                one person, then it'll all be worth it.</p>
                <p>PS: You can find me personally on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/kiriappeee">@kiriappeee</a></p>
                <p>PPS: I know the site is full of jank right now. I'll be slowly fixing that up as time goes by. My primary
                focus right now is to get down to writing :)</p>
